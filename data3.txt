With a wind field model like this, you can ask your quadrotor's piloting software to compute a minimum energy trajectory between any two points. Depending on what the wind is doing, this may result in a path that's not the shortest distance, which is what the quadrotor would be trying to do if the wind wasn't a factor. But since the wind is a factor, the quadrotor will instead look for ways that it can minimize headwinds and maximize tailwinds, resulting in some common sense behaviors. In the example below, the planner that accounts for the wind has the quadrotor sheltering next to and downwind from structures, while the traditional direct route planner exposes the quadrotor to a strong headwind.
